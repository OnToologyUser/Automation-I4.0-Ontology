# Automation-I4.0-Ontology
### Initial commit 04/01/2019
The Automation-I4.0-Ontology is intended to cover a new perspective of the automation systems by means of the use of the Semantic Web Technologies(SWT).

The main ontology `Automation-I4.0-Ontology.owl or .rdf` is composed by several modules which contain specific semantic models.
- The Automation-I4.0-Core-Ontology `automation-I4.0-core-ontology-v1.3.owl` which contains the core, the body of the complete ontology.
- The Discrete-Dynamics-Ontology (DDO) `ddo-v2.owl` which contains the semantic representation of discrete dynamics models (Automatas, Petri Nets).
- The Minified-Standards-Ontology `min-std-o.owl` which is a little ontology to integrate the partial main ontology (`Automation-I4.0-Min-Ontology.owl`) with the Standards Ontology (`sto-owl.owl`).
- The Standards Ontology `sto-owl.owl` by Grangel et al (https://github.com/i40-Tools/StandardOntology) serialized in owl format.

The integrated Automation-I4.0-Ontology with the STO is not yet stable to use with any reasoner. I recommend to use the Automation-I4.0-Min-Ontology by now; it is the same ontology without the Standards Ontology.

## Features

### Core Ontology
The core ontology is composed by several classes and axioms.  
It contains many well-defined SWRL rules.  
The ontology works fine at 95% approx.  

### DDO
It is the more difficult and low-level ontology. Contains several aspects of discrete dynamics desing for Automatas and Petri Nets.  
Unlike to common Automata-PN models, it provides high-level and advanced concepts which enable "cognitive" aspects for automation systems in the Industry 4.0.  
As it has many features, some more useful than others, it may lack of other ones (It is a complex task to define such concepts). Feel free to contribute with them.

### Minified Standards Ontology
It is a simple ontology that makes easier the integration of the STO and the Automation-I4.0-Min-Ontology.  
It has few classes.  
It has some well-defined SWRL rules.  
It works fine.  

### STO
The Standards Ontology is a work done by Irl√°n Grangel, Steffen Lohman, and Paul Baptista at Fraunhofer IAIS. Please see https://github.com/i40-Tools/StandardOntology , https://vocol.iais.fraunhofer.de/sto/ for more details.  
I make a special acknowledge for such work and their support with the STO code.  


## Research
This project is being carried out currently under my master's thesis "A proposal of a formal model to integrate distributed service-based automation systems, semantic models, and automation standards.".  
I keep on doing enhancements and adding new features while doing my research project.  
- No publications have been published yet.


## Applications
I am currently working on some applications to deploy the ontology in an real-operative automation system with distributed environment.  

## Contribution and support
If you are interested in contribute to this project, feel free to do it.  
Regarding to the support, I am working on it continuosly, so, if any problem appears, do not hesitate to create an issue.
